# Solution Engineer MSX/MCEM Operations

## Purpose
This skill defines the Solution Engineer (SE) day-to-day operating model in MSX/MCEM with one primary behavior:
- Keep milestone `tasks` current and actionable.

It standardizes when SE should:
- add/update milestone tasks,
- hand off uncommitted milestones to CSU roles after BANT is established,
- continue task updates on committed milestones where SE influenced outcome.

## When to Use
- Daily/weekly milestone hygiene for active opportunities.
- Uncommitted milestone is becoming ready for CSU execution and BANT is available.
- Committed milestone was SE-influenced and tasks need to be created/updated to keep execution unblocked.
- Stage 2/3/4 transitions need explicit task ownership and handoff clarity.

## Runtime Contract
- Read tools are live: `crm_auth_status`, `crm_whoami`, `list_accounts_by_tpid`, `list_opportunities`, `get_milestones`, `get_milestone_activities`, `crm_get_record`, `crm_query`, `get_task_status_options`.
- Write-intent tools are dry-run: `create_task`, `update_task`, `close_task`, `update_milestone` return `mock: true` previews.
- No execute/cancel staging endpoints: treat write-tool output as recommended updates.
- Follow `.github/instructions/msx-role-and-write-gate.instructions.md` for mandatory human confirmation before write-intent operations.

## WorkIQ MCP for M365 Evidence
- Use WorkIQ MCP (`ask_work_iq`) when required context is in Microsoft 365 sources rather than CRM tables.
- Typical sources: Teams chat/channel threads, meeting transcripts/notes, Outlook email/calendar, SharePoint/OneDrive docs.
- Use CRM + WorkIQ together:
   - CRM tools provide system-of-record status and identifiers.
   - WorkIQ provides evidence used to explain blockers, decisions, and ownership signals.

## Shared Definitions
- Opportunity: customer engagement container aligned to MCEM stage outcomes.
- Milestone: execution unit for commitment, delivery, and usage/consumption outcomes.
- Uncommitted: still shaping and not fully resourced for delivery.
- Committed: customer agreement plus internal readiness for execution.
- Influenced (SE): SE materially shaped technical direction, proof outcome, objections, or commitment confidence.
- BANT-ready: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline are sufficiently evidenced for transition planning.

## Core Operating Loop (SE Daily)
1. Get active opportunities and milestones in scope.
2. For each milestone, verify task hygiene:
   - owner,
   - due date,
   - status,
   - blocker text,
   - completion condition.
3. Add missing tasks and update stale tasks.
4. Branch by commitment state:
   - uncommitted: validate BANT and decide if CSU handoff is appropriate,
   - committed: if SE influenced, continue updating/creating tasks until clear owner-driven execution is stable.
5. Return concise action set with owner + due date for each task.

## Role Mission and Accountability
### Mission
Drive technical win quality through disciplined milestone-task management and timely cross-role handoff.

### Stage Accountability
- Stages 1–2: shape technical need and proof plan; keep uncommitted milestone tasks current.
- Stage 3: drive proof execution and task clarity; remove blockers quickly.
- Stages 4–5: preserve continuity through CSU handoff and post-commitment task hygiene on SE-influenced milestones.

### MSX Hygiene Expectations
- Add SE to deal team when materially contributing.
- Maintain task-level accuracy on milestones SE touches.
- Avoid milestone-level ambiguity by expressing execution via concrete tasks.

## Inputs Required
- Opportunity stage, owner roles, and milestone category.
- Milestone commitment state (`uncommitted` or `committed`).
- Current milestone tasks and statuses.
- SE influence signal (`yes/no` + brief reason).
- BANT evidence state for uncommitted milestones.
- Delivery path and attribution fields (partner, ISD, CSA, customer).

## Primary Decision Policy
### A) Uncommitted Milestones
- SE owns task hygiene and technical shaping tasks.
- If BANT is not ready:
  - keep milestone uncommitted,
  - update/create tasks to close BANT gaps.
- If BANT is ready and transition is appropriate:
  - prepare handoff to CSU roles (`Cloud Solution Architect`, `CSAM`),
  - include explicit role asks and next tasks.

### B) Committed Milestones
- If SE influenced commitment/outcome:
  - continue updating/creating tasks to protect delivery continuity,
  - ensure blockers, owners, due dates, and acceptance signals remain current.
- If SE did not influence and no active technical dependency exists:
  - avoid unnecessary task churn,
  - provide monitoring note only.

## Operating Procedure
1. Resolve role and scope (`crm_auth_status` + selected role workflow).
2. Pull milestone set (`get_milestones(opportunityId)`).
3. Pull activities where progression is unclear (`get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)`).
4. Perform task hygiene checks for each milestone.
5. Apply commitment branch policy:
   - uncommitted + BANT-ready => CSU handoff preparation,
   - committed + SE-influenced => task updates continue.
6. Build dry-run write plan (`create_task`, `update_task`, `close_task`, optional `update_milestone`).
7. Produce confirmation packet before any write-intent execution.

## Guardrails (Pass/Fail)
### 1) Task Completeness
- PASS: every active milestone has next-step tasks with owner, due date, and status.
- FAIL action: create/update missing or stale tasks.

### 2) Uncommitted BANT Gate
- PASS: BANT evidence exists and milestone is suitable for CSU execution handoff.
- FAIL action: keep uncommitted and add tasks specifically targeting missing B/A/N/T items.

### 3) CSU Handoff Quality
- PASS: handoff includes customer outcome, technical decisions, blockers, role asks (`CSA`, `CSAM`), and immediate tasks.
- FAIL action: do not mark handoff-ready; update tasks to complete missing artifacts.

### 4) Committed Influenced Follow-through
- PASS: for committed milestones influenced by SE, tasks remain current until execution ownership is stable.
- FAIL action: refresh tasks and owners; log explicit next actions.

## Handoff Rules (Uncommitted → CSU)
Use handoff when all are true:
- milestone remains operationally uncommitted,
- BANT is sufficiently evidenced,
- execution needs CSU ownership alignment.

Handoff packet must include:
- customer/account and opportunity identifiers,
- current milestone and task state,
- BANT summary,
- requested actions for `CSA` and `CSAM`,
- first 1–3 tasks with owners and due dates.

## Cross-role Communication and Handoff
### CSA
- Engage for feasibility/execution readiness and architecture constraints.
- Receive BANT-qualified uncommitted handoff package when CSU execution planning is needed.

### Specialist (STU)
- Align during stages 1–3 on solution play, proof scope, and required resources.

### CSAM
- Engage for customer success execution planning when BANT-qualified handoff is made.
- On committed, SE-influenced milestones, coordinate task ownership transitions and continuity.

### Escalation Triggers
- Technical proof blocked more than 7 days without unblock path.
- Milestone dates materially diverge from delivery reality.
- Capacity/region constraints require specialized routing.

## Declarative MCP Flows
### Flow A: Daily/Weekly Milestone Task Hygiene
Trigger: weekly cadence or pre-review hygiene pass.

Steps:
1. `crm_auth_status`
2. `list_accounts_by_tpid(tpids)` when account scope is needed
3. `list_opportunities(accountIds)`
4. `get_milestones(opportunityId)`
5. `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for unclear progression
6. `crm_query(...)` only when extra technical fields are required

Decision logic:
- Flag stale/missing tasks first.
- Prioritize by near-term due date, blocker severity, and commitment impact.

Output schema:
- `task_hygiene_findings`
- `suggested_updates`
- `cross_role_note`

### Flow B: Uncommitted BANT-to-CSU Handoff
Trigger: uncommitted milestone with potential readiness for CSU execution.

Steps:
1. `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and isolate uncommitted milestones
2. `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for BANT and readiness evidence
3. `crm_get_record(entitySet='opportunities', id=opportunityId, select=...)`
4. Propose dry-run remediation actions:
   - `update_milestone(...)`
   - `create_task(...)`
   - `update_task(...)`

Decision logic:
- If BANT-ready and appropriate, issue CSU handoff packet with `CSA` + `CSAM` asks.
- If not BANT-ready, keep uncommitted and create/update BANT-closing tasks.

Output schema:
- `bant_status` (`ready` | `not_ready`)
- `evidence_summary`
- `dry_run_updates`
- `csu_handoff_packet`

### Flow C: Committed Influenced Milestone Follow-through
Trigger: committed milestone where SE influence is `yes`.

Steps:
1. `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and isolate committed milestones influenced by SE
2. `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for progression and blocker evidence
3. Dry-run updates:
   - `update_task(...)`
   - `create_task(...)`
   - `close_task(...)` when completion criteria are met

Decision logic:
- Keep task updates active until owner-driven execution is stable and clear.
- If dependency is no longer active, provide minimal monitoring note.

Output schema:
- `influenced_committed_status`
- `task_update_plan`
- `blockers`
- `role_asks`
- `proposed_tasks` (dry-run)

### Flow D: M365 Evidence Companion (WorkIQ)
Trigger: CRM status is unclear and corroboration is needed from collaboration artifacts.

Steps:
1. Build scope (customer, opportunity, people, date range, source types).
2. Call WorkIQ MCP (`ask_work_iq`) for Teams/meetings/Outlook/SharePoint evidence.
3. Compare evidence with `get_milestones(...)` and `get_milestone_activities(...)`.
4. Produce a concise `evidence_vs_crm` summary and dry-run remediation proposals if gaps exist.

Output schema:
- `fact_map`
- `m365_evidence_summary`
- `crm_alignment_findings`
- `suggested_updates` (dry-run)

## Decision Branches
- If milestone is uncommitted and BANT is incomplete: do not hand off; update BANT-closing tasks.
- If milestone is uncommitted and BANT is complete: create CSU handoff packet (`CSA`, `CSAM`) and transition tasks.
- If milestone is committed and SE influenced: continue task updates until stable execution ownership is explicit.
- If milestone is committed and SE did not influence: limit to hygiene-only interventions.

## Completion Criteria
- Every active milestone has current, owner-assigned tasks.
- Uncommitted milestones are either BANT-closing or BANT-qualified and handed off to CSU roles.
- Committed SE-influenced milestones have updated tasks reflecting real execution state.
- MSX-ready note captures owner, due date, and next action per task.

## Output Format
Produce:
1. Milestone classification (`uncommitted`/`committed`, `influenced` yes/no)
2. Guardrail pass/fail
3. Task actions (`create`/`update`/`close`)
4. Handoff decision (if uncommitted: BANT + CSU handoff yes/no)
5. Immediate owner plus due date
6. MSX-ready update text (concise)
