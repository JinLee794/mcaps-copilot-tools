## Shared definitions (applies to all roles)

- **MSX record types**
  - **Opportunity**: The customer engagement container aligned to MCEM stages and exit criteria.
  - **Milestone**: The execution unit for commitment, delivery, and usage/consumption outcomes.
  - **Account / Customer Priority / Plan**: The planning context that informs what the opportunity should achieve.

- **Commitment language**
  - **Uncommitted**: Still shaping; not fully resourced/approved for delivery.
  - **Committed**: Customer agreement + internal readiness; handoff to execution & value realization.

- **Handoff goals**
  - Preserve continuity (no “reset” of customer context)
  - Maintain data integrity (MSX is the system of record)
  - Make next steps explicit (who does what by when)

## Role: Cloud Solution Architect (CSA)

### Mission (in MCEM/MSX)
Own the **customer technical success path** and ensure committed opportunities are executable, measurable, and progressing to outcomes—using MSX as the system of record.

### Primary accountabilities by MCEM stage
- **Stages 1–3 (Listen & Consult → Empower & Achieve)**
  - Contribute architecture direction, feasibility assessment, and technical risk management.
  - Align delivery approach with customer priorities and success plan.
- **Stage 4 (Realize Value)**
  - Drive execution readiness and value realization plans.
  - Partner with CSAM on success plan execution signals.
- **Stage 5 (Manage & Optimize)**
  - Maintain solution health, optimize usage/adoption, and identify expansion pathways.

### MSX ownership & hygiene expectations
**You are accountable for execution integrity in MSX once an opportunity/milestone is committed and within your scope.**

**Own / Update in MSX**
- Ensure the committed milestones you own have:
  - correct owners, realistic dates, accurate risk status
  - the right delivery motion captured (who delivers, how, and dependencies)
- Update fields used for planning/forecast and technical execution (e.g., region/capacity indicators when applicable).

**Hygiene cadence**
- Weekly: review committed milestones, especially those due in next 30–60 days.
- Monthly: confirm stage alignment and that execution evidence exists.

### Cross-role communication (how CSA works with others)
#### With Solution Engineer (SE)
- **Receive**: technical proof outcomes, architecture choices, and risk notes.
- **Provide**: execution plan validation, delivery dependencies, and what’s required for stage transition.

#### With Specialist (STU Specialist)
- **Align**: scope and outcomes, programs/investments, and any architecture guardrails.
- **Communicate**: what “ready for commit” looks like from a delivery perspective.

#### With CSAM
- **Partner**: customer success plan, usage/adoption milestones, and health signals.
- **Handoff**: when delivery is underway, ensure CSAM has measurable success metrics and cadence.

### Handoff checklist (Specialist/SE → CSA)
- Proof results and architectural decision points captured.
- Customer success measures defined (baseline + target).
- Delivery dependencies identified (people, partner, capacity, environment, security).

### Escalation triggers
- Committed milestone is at-risk/blocked with no recovery plan.
- Customer success measures are missing or unmeasurable.
- Significant scope drift that affects outcomes or timeline.

### CSA Boundary Rules & Friction Scenarios

#### CSA is / CSA is not
**CSA is responsible for**
- Execution readiness and technical integrity.
- Architecture feasibility, dependency sequencing, and technical risk posture.
- Technical truth in MSX (risk state, dependencies, and execution blockers).

**CSA is not responsible for**
- Day-to-day delivery PM functions.
- Partner staffing, dispatch operations, or partner-side tooling hygiene.
- Commercial ownership or new-opportunity pipeline ownership.

#### Stage-based escalation rules
- **Stages 1–3 (Shaping / pre-commit)**
  - Require CSA execution-readiness confirmation before commitment.
  - If delivery motion, environment prerequisites, or success metrics are missing, mark as not ready to commit.
- **Stage 4 (Realize Value / execution)**
  - CSA engages for technical decisions, architecture constraints, and technical blockers.
  - CSAM leads delivery execution escalations (resourcing, schedule, customer expectation resets).
- **Stage 5 (Manage & Optimize)**
  - CSA identifies optimization and expansion signals.
  - Specialist/ATU owns conversion of expansion signals into net-new opportunity motions.

#### Common friction scenarios and guardrails

**1) “CSA as delivery owner” vs “CSA as execution architect” confusion**
- **Common symptom**: CSA is assigned as milestone owner while delivery motion is Partner/ISD/Unified.
- **Guardrail**: Preserve CSA accountability on readiness/integrity, and route delivery ownership to delivery roles.
- **Agent guardrail**: Auto-flag owner-motion mismatches for reassignment or role clarification.

**2) Stage 3 → Stage 4 handoff gaps (STU → CSU)**
- **Common symptom**: Opportunity is committed before execution metadata is complete.
- **Guardrail**: Commitment requires CSA readiness sign-off and complete execution prerequisites.
- **Required checks**: delivery motion, environment prerequisites, success metrics (baseline + target).

**3) Unified Services ambiguity (CSA vs CSAM vs ISD)**
- **Common symptom**: Unified dependencies appear only after commitment and block startup.
- **Guardrail**: CSA surfaces feasibility constraints early; CSAM owns expectation management and escalation.
- **Required action**: Document Unified blockers and date impact in milestone comments/risk narrative.

**4) Milestone ownership vs “truth maintenance” tension**
- **Common symptom**: CSA is not creator/owner but receives alerts and expected cleanup work.
- **Guardrail**: CSA updates technical truth fields; ownership/admin mismatches are escalated, not absorbed.
- **Required action**: Update technical risk/dependencies and route administrative ownership corrections.

**5) “CSA as escalation sink” during execution**
- **Common symptom**: Delivery or commercial issues are routed to CSA by default.
- **Guardrail**: CSA engages only when technical decisions are required.
- **Deflection language**:
  - “This is a delivery execution issue—CSAM to lead.”
  - “This requires partner resourcing escalation.”

**6) Expansion vs optimization confusion (Stage 5)**
- **Common symptom**: Optimization insights are either duplicated as pipeline or lost in execution tasks.
- **Guardrail**: CSA records expansion signals; Specialist/ATU owns opportunity creation.
- **Required action**: Capture signal + owner routing in MSX tasks/comments before opportunity creation.

## Agent Skills (declarative MCP flows)

### Runtime contract (current server behavior)
- **Read tools are live**: `crm_auth_status`, `crm_whoami`, `list_accounts_by_tpid`, `list_opportunities`, `get_milestones`, `get_milestone_activities`, `crm_get_record`, `crm_query`, `get_task_status_options`.
- **Write-intent tools are dry-run**: `create_task`, `update_task`, `close_task`, `update_milestone` return preview payloads (`mock: true`).
- **Staged execution pattern is documented but not exposed as tools yet**: treat write outputs as approval-ready recommendations.

### WorkIQ MCP companion (M365 retrieval)
- Use WorkIQ MCP (`ask_work_iq`) for collaboration evidence that is not modeled in CRM entities.
- Primary M365 sources: Teams chats/channels, meetings/transcripts, Outlook email/calendar, SharePoint/OneDrive docs.
- Use this companion pattern:
  - CRM tools answer ownership/status/execution integrity.
  - WorkIQ answers discussion history, decision rationale, and document/meeting evidence.

### Skill: "Committed Milestone Execution Monitor"
**Trigger**: Daily/weekly execution sweep for committed scope.

**Flow**:
1. Call `crm_auth_status`.
2. Resolve account/opportunity scope:
  - `list_accounts_by_tpid(tpids)` when starting from TPID.
  - `list_opportunities(accountIds)` to enumerate open opportunities.
3. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and filter committed milestones.
4. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for each at-risk/blocked candidate.
5. Generate dry-run corrective updates with `update_milestone(...)` and follow-up tasks via `create_task(...)`.

**Decision logic**:
- Classify execution state: on_track | at_risk | blocked based on date proximity, activity evidence, and missing ownership/comments.
- Escalate when no recovery activity exists for a near-term committed milestone.

**Output schema**:
- `risk_dashboard`: milestone-level status with reason codes
- `remediation_plan`: owner + action + due date
- `dry_run_operations`: update/task preview payloads

### Skill: "Stage 4–5 Value Realization Pack"
**Trigger**: Opportunity enters Realize Value / Manage & Optimize.

**Flow**:
1. Call `crm_get_record(entitySet='opportunities', id=opportunityId, select=...)`.
2. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and isolate value/adoption milestones.
3. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` to verify execution cadence.
4. If outcomes are under-specified, call `update_milestone(...)` (dry-run) for measurable comments/use updates.
5. If orchestration actions are missing, call `create_task(...)` (dry-run) for CSAM/CSU actions.

**Decision logic**:
- Mark pack complete only when each value milestone has metric intent, owner, date, and next activity.
- If evidence is weak, output mandatory gap closures before declaring value realization readiness.

**Output schema**:
- `value_checklist`
- `measurement_plan`
- `csam_ready_summary`
- `dry_run_gap_fixes`

### Skill: "Architecture-to-Execution Handoff Note"
**Trigger**: Proof complete or commitment flips uncommitted → committed.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` to identify impacted milestones.
2. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for proof traces.
3. Call `crm_query(entitySet='tasks', filter=..., select=...)` if broader dependency tracking is required.
4. Draft handoff with explicit asks; include dry-run `create_task(...)` payloads for missing owners/actions.

**Decision logic**:
- Handoff is not execution-ready if constraints, dependencies, or success metrics are implicit.

**Output schema**:
- `architecture_summary`
- `constraints`
- `deliverables`
- `risks`
- `success_metrics`
- `next_actions` (with dry-run task proposals)

### Skill: "Execution Readiness vs Delivery Ownership Disambiguator"
**Trigger**: CSA listed as milestone owner while delivery motion indicates Partner/ISD/Unified ownership.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and collect owner + delivery motion fields.
2. Call `crm_query(entitySet='tasks', filter=..., select=...)` for ownership/coordination tasks.
3. Identify owner-motion mismatches and impacted due dates.
4. Produce dry-run `update_milestone(...)` recommendations for ownership clarification comments/risk notes.
5. Produce dry-run `create_task(...)` recommendations to assign delivery-accountability actions.

**Decision logic**:
- If milestone owner is CSA and delivery motion is non-CSA delivery, classify as boundary_mismatch.
- If no explicit delivery accountable owner exists, classify as execution_risk.

**Output schema**:
- `boundary_mismatch_report`
- `role_clarification_actions`
- `dry_run_reassignments`

### Skill: "Stage 4 Readiness Gatekeeper"
**Trigger**: Opportunity is approaching commitment or transitioning into Stage 4.

**Flow**:
1. Call `crm_get_record(entitySet='opportunities', id=opportunityId, select=...)`.
2. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` for commitment-bound milestones.
3. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for execution evidence.
4. Validate required readiness metadata: delivery motion, environment prerequisites, and success metrics.
5. Generate dry-run `update_milestone(...)` and `create_task(...)` gap-closure actions.

**Decision logic**:
- Block readiness if any non-negotiable metadata is missing.
- Mark ready_for_commit only when CSA confirmation and all required metadata are present.

**Output schema**:
- `readiness_gate_status`
- `missing_requirements`
- `dry_run_gate_closures`

### Skill: "Unified Readiness Early Warning"
**Trigger**: Milestones include Unified-dependent execution paths.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and isolate Unified-related milestones.
2. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` to detect eligibility/accreditation/dispatch evidence.
3. If missing, draft dry-run `update_milestone(...)` risk/status updates.
4. Draft dry-run `create_task(...)` actions for CSAM and Specialist escalation/coordination.

**Decision logic**:
- If Unified dependency exists without eligibility evidence, classify as unified_blocker_risk.
- If customer timeline depends on Unified and no contingency exists, classify as schedule_impact_high.

**Output schema**:
- `unified_dependency_report`
- `timeline_impact_summary`
- `dry_run_early_warning_actions`

### Skill: "Technical Truth vs Admin Noise Filter"
**Trigger**: CSA receives milestone alerts with mixed technical and administrative actions.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` for affected milestones.
2. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for supporting evidence.
3. Classify each alert/action as technical_truth_required or admin_reroute.
4. Draft dry-run `update_milestone(...)` only for technical-truth changes.
5. Draft dry-run `create_task(...)` rerouting actions for ownership/admin corrections.

**Decision logic**:
- Technical risk/dependency/feasibility updates are CSA-actionable.
- Pure ownership/admin completeness without technical change is rerouted.

**Output schema**:
- `alert_classification`
- `csa_action_set`

### Skill: "M365 Execution Evidence Correlator"
**Trigger**: CSA needs proof of execution context beyond CRM comments/activities.

**Flow**:
1. Build scoped query (customer/opportunity, people, timeframe, source types).
2. Call WorkIQ MCP (`ask_work_iq`) to retrieve relevant Teams/meeting/Outlook/SharePoint evidence.
3. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)`.
4. Compare M365 evidence with CRM status and draft dry-run gap closures via `update_milestone(...)` and `create_task(...)`.

**Output schema**:
- `m365_evidence_map`
- `execution_integrity_findings`
- `dry_run_corrections`
- `reroute_action_set`

### Skill: "Escalation Classification Assistant"
**Trigger**: Execution issue is escalated to CSA and routing is unclear.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for context.
2. Optionally call `crm_query(entitySet='tasks', filter=..., select=...)` for open actions.
3. Classify issue as technical | delivery | commercial.
4. Draft dry-run task routing with `create_task(...)` to correct owner role.

**Decision logic**:
- Technical architecture constraints → CSA-owned path.
- Delivery execution/resourcing/schedule → CSAM or delivery owner path.
- Commercial/scope negotiation → Specialist/sales path.

**Output schema**:
- `issue_type`
- `recommended_owner`
- `dry_run_routing_tasks`

### Skill: "Expansion Signal Router"
**Trigger**: Stage 5 optimization insights may imply expansion opportunities.

**Flow**:
1. Call `get_milestones(opportunityId)` and isolate optimize/adoption outcomes.
2. Call `get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` for evidence of unmet potential or extension patterns.
3. Draft dry-run `create_task(...)` to route expansion signal to Specialist/ATU owner.
4. Draft dry-run `update_milestone(...)` comments to preserve signal context in MSX.

**Decision logic**:
- If optimization insight changes business scope but lacks owner routing, classify as expansion_signal_unrouted.
- Do not treat signal capture as automatic net-new opportunity creation.

**Output schema**:
- `expansion_signal_log`
- `owner_routing_plan`
- `dry_run_signal_tasks`
